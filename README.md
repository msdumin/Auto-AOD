Auto AOD is developed for Samsung s10/s10+/s10e.

As the notification LED is absent on Samsung S10 and Samsung company may not update the software solution, I 
create this app to take advantage of the Samsung's AOD(Always On Display) feature to show me the new un-read 
notifications. Other than some apps before, it just enable the system's AOD when a new notification comes
instead of drawing a circle or showing some info on a black screen. When you unlock your phone, the AOD state 
will be restored. 

This app is desired to save more battery, so it has any permissions/traces and unnecessary functions. 

(For Chinese)To ensure this app can be running forever, Please enable the "Auto Running" of this app
 in system settings.
